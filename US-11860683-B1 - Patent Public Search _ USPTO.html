        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Disclosed subject matter benchmarks and aligns content with 
target audiences. A user may provide content to a language intelligence 
platform. Scores are then generated by analyzing the content based on 
values-specific dictionaries, which reflect values of targeted 
audiences. Based on a comparison between a generated score and a 
benchmark values score for the target audience, appropriate action may 
be taken. Disclosed teachings support multiple layers of comparisons and
 score calculations including comparisons and scoring of all text, 
segments of text, and specific phrases to achieve a more comprehensive 
analysis. Embodiments may determine whether headers or other sections 
that may garner more attention, are aligned with a benchmark. Instead of
 suggesting alternative content, customer-specific benchmarks may tailor
 the analysis to align with customer's goals and priorities, potentially
 resulting in additional performance indicators that support the 
identification of correlations and predictive lexical patterns of higher
 performing content.</p>

        <h3>Background/Summary</h3>
        <p>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
(1) The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent 
Application No. 63/216,266 filed on Jun. 29, 2021 and titled “System and
 Method for Benchmarking and Aligning Content to Target Audiences”, the 
entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
        <p>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>(1) The present invention relates to 
the field of language and text analysis, specifically benchmarking 
distinct user group attitudes and aligning content with target audience 
appeal to achieve user-defined objectives while taking into account 
user-defined values, tone, and style.<br>BACKGROUND<br>(2) A current 
area of active research in machine learning and language prediction 
systems is the automatic generation of realistic text given a set of 
user-defined parameters. It is generally considered advantageous to 
tailor and optimize a document to ensure it captures the attention of an
 intended audience. Different groups of the population have different 
values and care about different things. Differences in values may be 
indicative of why different groups shop at different places, read 
different books, think differently and use different language to 
communicate. However, without prior knowledge of the values of specific 
audiences, content providers may not know which words resonate with each
 target audience. For example, certain people shop at Whole Foods 
Market™ for their groceries, while other people shop at Trader Joe's™. 
While both stores are American chain grocery stores, their customers may
 have different profiles that reflect different values and/or other 
characteristics of each group. In addition, conventional language 
prediction systems generally face challenges regarding accuracy. For 
example, these generated language prediction systems lack reliability 
and interpretability. Interpretability is the degree to which a machine 
learning model can be understood in human terms. The higher the 
interpretability, the more a human can consistently predict the model's 
result and understand the reasoning or relevant knowledge behind the 
predictions and decisions made by the model given the relationships 
contained in the data. The quality of a machine learning model is only 
as good as the data used to train and generate the model. The 
fundamental values used as the basis for our machine learning models are
 generally better at identifying the relationships and patterns between 
the language used for various segments of the population.<br>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>(3)
 Subject matter included herein draws upon a universal values model and a
 system with empirical support that captures the ideals that shape 
subjective beliefs and actions of individuals and groups in society. 
Values are core to social sciences in explaining motivational bases of 
perspective and behavior. They are inherently different from other 
concepts commonly used to explain behavior such as attitudes, 
personality, beliefs, norms, and traits. Values are trans-situational 
and not limited in the situations which they can be applied. Values are 
also more than descriptive variables or patterns of thinking and 
feeling. They are motivational variables of learned nature and deeply 
held principles that guide people's choices and influence emotions. 
Disclosed subject matter also utilizes psychological considerations 
including, but not limited to, the mere exposure effect (also known as 
the familiarity principle) and the concept of perceptual fluency. The 
mere exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon whereby people tend 
to develop a preference for certain things based on the frequency at 
which a user becomes exposed to said thing or person. Perceptual fluency
 is an unconscious and automatic memory whereby a subject is not 
necessarily aware of the prior exposure to the stimulus. All these 
considerations contribute to the accurate assessment of how well a text 
aligns with a certain target audience.<br>(4) The above-referenced 
problems are addressed and other advantages are realized by methods and 
systems of the present disclosure, which benchmark and align content 
with target audiences. In at least one embodiment, a user provides 
content to a language intelligence platform via a text entry interface. 
Scores are generated by analyzing all or portions of the content based 
on values-specific dictionaries, i.e., dictionaries that reflect the 
values of targeted audiences. Values may be defined as the principles 
and attitudes that drive a person's decision making. Based on the 
comparison of the score with a benchmark values score for the target 
audience, alternative content is suggested to the user.<br>(5) 
Addressing the previously referenced accuracy challenges of prior art, 
the teachings of the subject matter disclosed herein allow for multiple 
layers of comparisons and score calculations including, as non-limiting 
examples, comparisons and scoring of all text, segments of text, and 
specific phrases. Utilizing multiple layers of comparison ensures a more
 comprehensive analysis of the content. A more refined understanding is 
achieved by determining whether certain sections are aligned with a 
benchmark. This can be beneficial when, as an example, determining 
whether a header is aligned by itself versus the whole document. A title
 or section heading often garners the most attention given its 
prominence and location. Thus, it is imperative that this content 
accurately align with the target audience values to generate the most 
impact. Providing a benchmark score as a standard to compare against 
beneficially improves quality. In at least some alternative embodiments,
 the practice of suggesting alternative content to increase scores is 
omitted. Instead, customer-specific benchmarks tailor the analysis to 
align with customer's goals and priorities. Multiple content across 
multiple platforms is evaluated. The analytics performed in place of the
 suggestion of alternative content, generates additional key performance
 indicators that allow the identification of the correlations and 
predictive lexical patterns of higher performing content.<br>(6) It will
 be understood that, as used in the following description and claims, 
the terms “content” and “electronic document” both refer to any 
document, media, webpage, or text.<br>(7) An embodiment of at least one 
method disclosed herein comprises providing, by a user, content to be 
evaluated with respect to how well the content aligns with a target 
audience; identifying a plurality of distinct values segments, which 
represent groupings of statistically different audience divisions that 
embody certain values; generating a language dictionary for each of the 
plurality of values segments that includes predictive words or phrases, 
wherein each word or phrase entry includes scores depending on the 
measured level of prediction (e.g., numerical values associated with 
predicting the appeal) of one or more values segment; setting a 
plurality of benchmark scores based on user defined specific alignment 
objectives; comparing a plurality of assessment scores with the 
plurality of benchmark scores to calculate an overall alignment 
assessment; and, based at least in part on the overall alignment 
assessment, suggesting modifications to the provided content to increase
 the overall alignment.<br>(8) An embodiment of disclosed subject matter
 teaches a non-transitory computer readable medium including 
computer-executable instructions that enable a computer to perform 
operations comprising providing, by a user, content to be evaluated with
 respect to how well the content aligns with a target audience; 
identifying a plurality of distinct values segments, which represent 
groupings of statistically different audience divisions that embody 
certain values; generating a language dictionary for each of the 
plurality of values segments that includes predictive words or phrases, 
wherein each word or phrase entry includes scores depending on the 
measured level of prediction of one or more values segment; setting a 
plurality of benchmark scores based on user defined specific alignment 
objectives; comparing a plurality of assessment scores with the 
plurality of benchmark scores to calculate an overall alignment 
assessment; and, based at least in part on the overall alignment 
assessment, suggesting modifications to the provided content to increase
 the overall alignment.<br>(9) An embodiment of subject matter disclosed
 herein teaches one or more computer systems, sometimes referred to 
herein simply as systems, suitable for evaluating an alignment of an 
electronic document with a target benchmark. Each such system may 
include a processor for executing computer program instructions and a 
non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing computer program
 instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the system to 
perform operations including receiving, from a user via a use interface,
 content to be evaluated with respect to how well the content aligns 
with a target audience; identifying a plurality of distinct values 
segments, which represent groupings of statistically different audience 
divisions that embody certain values; generating a language dictionary 
for each of the plurality of values segments that includes predictive 
words or phrases, wherein each word or phrase entry includes scores 
depending on the measured level of prediction of one or more values 
segment associated; setting a plurality of benchmark scores based on 
user defined specific alignment objectives; comparing a plurality of 
assessment scores with the plurality of benchmark scores to calculate an
 overall alignment assessment; and, based at least in part on the 
overall alignment assessment, suggesting modifications to the provided 
content to increase the overall alignment.</p>

 Certain embodiments of the disclosure may be found in a method and 
system for benchmarking and aligning content with target audiences. In 
such embodiments, a document or other content is provided by the user. 
Each word and phrase is analyzed and compared to generated dictionaries 
directed towards targeted audiences based on their values to generate a 
score. Based on the comparison of the score with a benchmark values for 
the target audience, alternative content is suggested to the user.<br>(10)
 Values are inherently different from other concepts commonly used to 
explain behavior such as attitudes, personality, beliefs, norms, and 
traits. Values are a central concept in social sciences that are crucial
 in explaining motivational bases of perspective and behavior. Values 
can be determined using Shalom Schwartz theory of basic values 
(Schwartz, S. H. (2012). An Overview of the Schwartz Theory of Basic 
Values. Online Readings in Psychology and Culture, 2(1). 
https://doi.org/10.9707/2307-0919.1116) or any similarly related social 
psychology models. Some embodiments may recognize five or more broad 
personal values that are differentiated by the underlying goal or 
motivation: self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, 
security, conformity, tradition, benevolence, and universalism. While 
other embodiments may recognize less of the broad personal values.<br>(11)
 As mentioned above, there are many language processing systems which 
provide content variants depending on different factors. Such systems, 
however, generally do not accurately align content variants with target 
audiences, nor do they take into account an ideal benchmark model.<br>(12) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary system <b>100</b> in accordance with disclosed subject matter. A client device <b>102</b>
 is a computing device such as a tablet computer, a laptop computer, 
smartphone, or any other type of network-enabled device. The client 
device <b>102</b> is communicatively connected by a network <b>110</b> to an analysis server <b>120</b> and administrative server <b>130</b>. Analysis server <b>120</b> and administrative server <b>130</b> may each be implemented with a computer including at least one processor (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) coupled to one or more memory and/or storage resources (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and one or more input/output I/O devices via a chipset (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).
 Storage resources may be implemented as non-transitory computer 
readable storage media such as a hard drive, compact disk read-only 
memory (CD-ROM), DVD, or a solid-state memory device. Memory resources 
may hold instructions and data used by the processor.<br>(13) The network <b>110</b> provides communication between the client devices <b>102</b>, analysis servers <b>120</b> and administrative servers <b>130</b>. The network <b>110</b>
 may include a public network such as the Internet, but may be any 
network, including but not limited to a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide 
Area Network (WAN), a mobile wired or wireless network, a private 
network, or a virtual private network.<br>(14) The illustrated analysis server <b>120</b> includes a Dictionary Generation Module <b>122</b>, an Alignment Assessment Module <b>124</b>, and a Suggestion Engine <b>126</b>. The illustrated client device <b>102</b> may provide text to the analysis server <b>120</b> via a User Interface <b>104</b>. Although there is only one instance depicted, there may be multiple instances of the client device <b>102</b> in communication with one or more analysis servers <b>120</b> or administration servers <b>130</b>.<br>(15) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram for an exemplary method <b>200</b> for benchmarking and aligning content to targeted audiences. At <b>201</b>, a user inputs content at the client device <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) using the User Interface <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The user then sets a benchmark target score at <b>202</b>.
 The benchmark target score represents an ideal mix of language 
distribution across an applicable values dictionary. In an exemplary 
embodiment, the machine-learned models based on the universal values 
generate five values segments: Safety First, Ladder, Hearth, Global Me, 
and Free Spirit; and each of these values segments may include a rank 
order, and a level of priority or weighting placed on the various 
universal values. Safety first values segments may prioritize protection
 and safety and can be characterized as risk avoidant, nostalgic, 
conservative leaning, self-reliant, keeps within their circle of 
friends, and price conscious. Ladder values segments may prioritize the 
importance of achievement and can be characterized as seeking to 
influence others, being on trend, progressive and conservative people, 
environmentally engaged, and more likely to be religious. Hearth values 
segments may prioritize tradition and can be characterized as being 
grounded in faith, thrifty/frugal, nostalgic, outdoor/country, 
self-reliant, appreciating simple happiness, civically engaged. Global 
Me values segments may prioritize self-expression and can be categorized
 as having a global perspective, self-expression, searches for meaning, 
civically engaged, environmentally engaged, values social justice, 
appreciates exploration, and a news consumer. Free Spirit values 
segments may prioritize variety and are characterized as being fun and 
enjoyment seekers, craves new, varied experiences, independent minded, 
not as active civically, thrill-seeking, middle of the road politically,
 interested in collectables, enjoys sports, and values self-direction. 
Target audiences will fall within any combination of these values 
segments. Depending on their classifications, different benchmarks will 
be set to reflect their alignment accordingly. As one example, a 
traveling enthusiast demographic might have higher benchmarks in Free 
Spirit and Global Me values segments, while medium to low benchmarks in 
the other values segments. A benchmark greater than 100 out of 300 may 
be deemed a priority values segment.<br>(16) The input content from <b>201</b> is then evaluated using the values segment dictionaries to generate respective assessment scores <b>203</b>.
 In at least one embodiment, content is traversed and words belonging to
 the various values segment dictionaries are identified. Within each 
values segment dictionary, a word or phrase entry includes a numerical 
score representing its likely appeal to each values segment. The 
associated scores for each instance identified in the dictionaries are 
aggregated to generate values segment assessment scores. In at least 
another embodiment, tone and/or style can be evaluated to generate an 
assessment score. An alignment score is calculated for each generated 
assessment score with respect to the corresponding benchmark target 
score at <b>204</b>. Subsequently, the Suggestion Engine <b>126</b> generates alternative content at <b>205</b>
 based on the values alignment assessment score, the tone alignment 
assessment score, the style alignment assessment score, overall 
alignment assessment, or any combination thereof. For example, the 
Suggestion Engine <b>126</b> suggests words that would improve the 
content alignment by coming closer to the benchmark target score for 
either values, tone, or stylistic elements, as well as when these 
elements are combined. The above process will be further elaborated with
 the respective drawings and descriptions below.<br>(17) In at least one
 embodiment, disclosed systems and method include and/or employ one or 
more Neural Networks. Neural Networks are a deep learning algorithm 
commonly used to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data. 
Traditional neural networks are structured to mimic the functioning of 
the human brain with neurons signaling to one another. There are various
 types of neural-network based methods used to generate models to deal 
with particular problems, including Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memories 
(LSTMs), and similar. Typically, there is an input layer, one or more 
hidden layers, followed by an output layer. Each node in a respective 
layer is connected to another node in the subsequent layer with an 
associated weight and threshold. Fully recurrent neural networks connect
 the outputs of all neurons to the inputs of all neurons. However, the 
neural network in our application dispenses with recurrence and 
convolutions entirely. This yields models of superior quality while 
allowing models to be more parallelizable and requiring significantly 
less time to train. In the exemplary embodiment, the neural network is 
trained with survey data of unstructured documents.<br>(18) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram that illustrates an exemplary generation method <b>300</b> of the values segment dictionaries in the Dictionary Generation Module <b>122</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> will now be discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. At <b>301</b>, consumer data is clustered into values segments, which represent groupings of statistically different audience divisions.<br>(19) Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an analysis server <b>120</b>
 receives training data input to the machine-learned models. In some 
implementations, data can be fetched from a variety of public or private
 sources or domains. For example, MRI Simmons data can be clustered 
using K-means around key attitudinal questions that can be aligned to 
the ten custom categories of the Universal Values Model. Highly 
predictive indicators are selected from the model. In one embodiment, 
variation within the clusters is analyzed to generate 3 segments; and 
these 3 segments are then expanded to at least 5 values segments based 
on the findings. In other embodiments, the number of generated segments 
and expanded values segments may be more or less than 3 and at least 
five, respectively.<br>(20) At <b>302</b>, relevant document sets are 
identified for each values segment. In some implementations, structured 
or unstructured language data is input by a user at the client device <b>102</b> using the platform User Interface <b>104</b>.
 In other implementations, content that indexes at a predetermined 
threshold for each segment is identified to generate a list of 
documents. For example, a threshold is computed to determine which URLs 
meet a high level of alignment with a values segment and which URLs show
 little to no correlation, or low alignment with a values segment. A 
list of URLs is identified for each values segment that satisfy the 
threshold level of alignment. Text is taken from each of the URLs on the
 list and filtered. Non-relevant URLs including but not limited to ads, 
footprints, disclaimers, privacy policies, etc., are removed from 
further scraping. In this embodiment, two levels of links within each 
specific domain on the homepage URL and other index pages are traversed 
and processed. In other embodiments, more or less levels of links within
 each specific domain on the homepage URL and other index pages may be 
traversed and processed.<br>(21) At <b>303</b>, a feature set is 
extracted from each document set. According to an exemplary embodiment, 
numerous linguistic and grammatical features are extracted from the 
processed document set. For example, words, phrases, high-frequency 
power words, linguistic inquiry and word count statistics and entities, 
N-grams, word embeddings, writing semantics, sentiments, tones, 
parse-trees, style and length can be extracted. The set of features 
uniquely characterize a document and indicate correlation to the values 
segments identified previously.<br>(22) At <b>304</b>, the Dictionary Generation Module <b>122</b>
 analyzes the extracted feature set to evaluate the alignment of words 
or phrases with each values segment. In some implementations, 
characteristics of extracted features, such as frequency, are measured 
and compared to the entire corpus of the values segment. The measured 
frequency is then compared to the high or low frequency of an out-group 
of the same segment. The highest quartiles of frequency where language 
appears is compared to the lowest quartiles of frequency. Highly 
predictive words exhibit higher frequency above a normalized mean of 
that values segment, while showing little to no frequency in the 
out-group. A word-level index is created based on this normalized mean 
so that words and phrases can be compared and scored across the values 
segments. Based on this scoring methodology, each segment exhibits 
distinct language characteristics. Words and phrases that are predictive
 are rarely highly predictive of more than two segments, and generally, 
are highly predictive of only one.<br>(23) At <b>305</b>, dictionaries are constructed for each values segment. In the exemplary embodiment, the Dictionary Generation Module <b>122</b>
 determines thresholds that define cut-offs and ceilings within each 
dictionary so that segment, word, or phrase indexes are not overly 
skewed based on outliers. The frequency scoring categorizes words and 
phrases into dictionaries of predictive words/phrases for each values 
segment. Other semantic features that are unique to each values segment 
are scored and are tagged as highly predictive of a segment. The more 
predictive a text feature is of a particular values segment, the higher 
it may be weighted in the scoring and optimization algorithm. Each 
dictionary may include entries of predictive words, phrases, or semantic
 features, with corresponding numerical amounts depending on the 
measured level of indication of a values segment.<br>(24) These 
dictionaries may be updated from time to time, either periodically or 
otherwise, by ingesting new corpuses of language to reflect the fact 
that words can change in appeal across the values segmented based on 
changing events in culture and the natural evolution of language.<br>(25) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram that illustrates an exemplary alignment assessment calculation method <b>400</b>. At <b>401</b>,
 the values assessment score is evaluated with respect to the values 
benchmark target score. In some embodiments, the text input by a user 
using the User Interface <b>104</b> is scored based on one or more 
values language dictionaries and associated language scoring. In the 
exemplary embodiment, the text input by a user using the User Interface <b>104</b>
 is scored based on at least five values language dictionaries and 
associated language scoring. Each values segment is associated with a 
distinct values language dictionary that includes words or phrases 
likely to appeal to the corresponding segment with numerical scores 
reflecting the level of appeal. Each instance in the values language 
dictionary has an associated positive of negative score. A values 
assessment score is generated by aggregating each instance of the values
 language dictionary present in the inputted text sample. A vector, or 
mapping of values appeal is generated for the input piece of content. 
The range of the values assessment score for each segment is 0-300, 
where 300 is the highest level of prediction of appeal for a given 
segment. Scores are compared to a predetermined threshold to identify 
the level of appeal. In the exemplary embodiment, scores above 100 are 
considered more appealing. Scores below 100 are considered less 
appealing.<br>(26) The values benchmark target score is set for each 
respective values segment. A values benchmark target score is set that 
represents a preferred mixture of language distribution across the 
various values dictionaries across the target segments. For instance, a 
preferred composition is displayed on an indexed scoring scale between 
0-300. Users can have multiple benchmark profiles that consist of a set 
of unique values benchmark target scores for each goal or target 
audience alignment. The user defines specific settings and information 
about their audience target groups. In some implementations, additional 
target demographic characteristics are also provided. These inputs are 
processed using both statistical and heuristic models to generate the 
benchmark target scores. Once the values benchmark target scores have 
been set with specific targets across the values segments, the values 
assessment score is compared to the values benchmark target score to 
determine relative similarity or alignment with the benchmark settings.<br>(27)
 In other implementations, multi-level scoring is performed. Alignment 
of text is scored as a whole and in components. For example, content is 
scored by analyzing the entire document to show the probability of that 
document to appeal the lexical profile of that values segment. Content 
may also be scored in the platform on a sentence and/or chunks level.<br>(28) The values alignment assessment score is on a scale of 1-100. The Alignment Assessment Module <b>124</b>
 calculates the absolute value of relative entropy to capture how far 
the values assessment score is from the values benchmark target score. 
Certain values benchmark target scores can be designated a priority. 
Determination is made whether the priority values benchmark target 
scores are met. If the values assessment score is below the values 
benchmark target score, a penalty is applied. If the values assessment 
score is above the values benchmark target score, a flat credit is 
applied for each segment. Subsequently, non-priority values benchmark 
target scores are assessed. A total sum of the penalties, and credits is
 then calculated and thresholded with 100.<br>(29) In accordance with 
the exemplary scenario, content can be provided separately on a per 
piece level, or at an aggregate results level through content feeds. 
Additional text is provided by the user to calculate their ideal values 
benchmark target score. Additional text could come in the form of top 
performing content, brand documentation, focus group transcripts, or 
combinations thereof. Target demographic characteristics may be provided
 by the user in the calculation of the values benchmark target score.<br>(30) At <b>402</b>,
 the tone assessment score is evaluated with the tone benchmark target 
score to calculate a tone alignment assessment score. In the exemplary 
embodiment, the analysis server <b>120</b> generates a machine learning 
model based on tone families and measures the presence of tones at high 
confidence levels for six to eight tone family groupings. In other 
embodiments, the analysis server <b>120</b> may generate a machine 
learning model based on tone families and measures the presence of tones
 at confidence levels for other ranges of family groupings. Manually 
collected and human-labeled families of tone datasets are input into the
 model. Tone evaluation is calculated using probabilistic models to 
predict the likelihood of the presence of a tone at a sentence of a 
statement level in a text. For instance, tones with predictions above 
50% are indicated and tones above 80% probability are emphasized in the 
model. Settings can be modified for the level of confidence to provide 
the capability of showing different rankings of potential tones to 
assess the efficacy of the accuracy for tone scoring for a particular 
sentence or statement.<br>(31) In a further embodiment, there is 
capability of adding additional tone families. Supervised and 
non-supervised learning is utilized. The previous datasets and models 
are regularly updated and used to retrain the tone detection machine 
learning model. The User also validates tone families in development 
beyond the current 6-8 tone family groupings. 5-10 additional tones at 
varying levels of recall and precision are tested and incorporated into 
the model.<br>(32) In accordance with the exemplary scenario, the User 
selects their ideal tones and provides content exemplifying the ideal 
tone. A priority tone mix is then determined from the information 
provided by the User such that the tone family groupings are loaded into
 the platform as one or more tone benchmarks. In one embodiment, 
document level scoring looks for highly predictive presence above 50% 
probability of the tone presence by sentence. Aggregate scores meeting a
 threshold of alignment for tone are based on User defined thresholds 
for percentage of individual tones or presence across the entire 
priority tone palette as compared to presence of any other/non-priority 
tones. This generates a tone alignment assessment score.<br>(33) At <b>403</b>,
 evaluation of a style assessment score with a style benchmark target 
score is calculated to generate a style alignment assessment score. In 
the exemplary embodiment, many factors can contribute to style. One 
factor can be complexity. A readability test is used to gauge the 
understanding of a text. Applying the readability test generates an 
index of an approximate representation of the school grade level needed 
to comprehend the text. Additional modifications are provided to the 
scoring mechanism of the test to accommodate non-formal communications 
such as short non-sentence marketing material, hashtags, user handles, 
URLs, and the like.<br>(34) Another factor can be formality. The 
formality level models ascertain the rigid observance of rules of 
convention or etiquette. There are datasets of differences between very 
informal to highly formal examples that express the same idea. For 
instance, “Howdy” and “Greetings” are both salutations on the varying 
spectrum of formality. Our models are sensitive to point of view 
(1.sup.st-person, 2.sup.nd-person, 3.sup.rd-person), use of 
contractions, colloquial expressions, slang and abbreviations and text 
language. Our platform reads for these items and scores content on a per
 sentence or chunk based for Informal to Formal style, assigning a 
classifier or score for level of Formal. In another embodiment, results 
are aggregated to a full text score. The formality and complexity scores
 are used to generate a style assessment score, which is then compared 
to a style benchmark target score to generate a style alignment 
assessment score.<br>(35) At <b>404</b>, an aggregate of the values 
alignment assessment score, tone alignment assessment score, and style 
alignment assessment score is calculated to form an overall alignment 
assessment score.<br>(36) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram that illustrates alternative content generation method <b>500</b>
 based on the overall alignment assessment. In the exemplary embodiment,
 if a scored piece of content does not meet one of the various 
benchmarks, varying levels of automated suggestions to the text can be 
provided in the platform User Interface <b>104</b>. The User can 
highlight or select from content that is underlined or shown to be 
underperforming in values or tone, and request optimization ideas or 
suggestions <b>501</b>. Up to 10 texts are generated for the sentence 
selected. These are scored for values, tone and style based on the 
machine learned models. The platform User Interface <b>104</b> 
automatically selects suggestions that materially improve the content 
score by coming to closer proximity to the benchmark target score for 
either values, tone, or stylistic elements as well as when these 
elements are combined <b>502</b>. The Suggestion Engine <b>126</b> also 
collects customer or language analysts feedback and validation for 
platform suggestions. This automatic feedback loop and data collection 
allows for further refinement from correctly suggested text that also 
meet the preferences of our customers.<br>(37) In another embodiment, 
customers identify whether a result is “Relevant/Good” or “Not Helpful” 
or given a rating of overall quality, and other potential feedback and 
can select from potential reasons of unhelpfulness from suggestions that
 receive low ratings. This input is incorporated into the machine 
learning models for values and customer-specific models. As increasingly
 diverse scored texts across platforms and styles grows, suggestion 
models are refined. Models will require less texts to be generated 
before displaying optimal texts to the user.<br>(38) A further embodiment of the suggestion engine includes document level suggestions. The Suggestion Engine <b>126</b>
 identifies all the underperforming sentences or chunks and compiles the
 best suggestions across underperforming segments of a text, using a 
content or text suggestion engine, and a version of the content that 
meets the benchmark is delivered in the platform to the requesting user 
and may be inserted or applied. The User Interface <b>104</b> depicts the before and after scoring, texts, and results for review.<br>(39)
 In accordance with another exemplary scenario, additional lexical 
signals are developed to refine the alignment assessment scoring and 
subsequent language recommendations. In one embodiment, there is a 
platform wide block list where perfunctory words are identified that do 
not apply to content scoring and benchmark alignment. Words or phrases 
present in this list would skew results if included in the language 
intelligence calculations. One example is the word “newsletter”. These 
words or phrases are removed from content scoring for all users of the 
platform.<br>(40) In another embodiment, there can be a 
customer-specific grey list wherein perfunctory words can be 
deemphasized in the content scoring and benchmark alignment process 
despite their predictive qualities. For example, “bank” may be generally
 predictive, but “bank” for a banking customer is not. Similarly, words 
that should be deemphasized based on other factors, such as their 
mandatory inclusion in search engine optimization considerations.<br>(41)
 In another embodiment, there can be customer-specific power words, 
phrases or larger language patterns and even customer specific 
“dictionaries:” wherein words or vocabulary or context that is 
particularly important or unique to that customer can be emphasized in 
content identification, scoring and suggestions and/or language 
generation and the benchmark alignment process.<br>(42) In a further 
embodiment, toxic or unsafe language can be determined using a pattern 
matching engine and/or other specially trained natural language 
processing (NLP) system. These words or phrases are omitted from the 
content scoring and benchmark alignment process. In yet another 
embodiment, customer-specific power words can be highlighted and 
featured in the content scoring and benchmark alignment process.<br>(43) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram that depicts an example user interface <b>600</b> (which may also be an example of User Interface <b>104</b>)
 for monitoring content alignment assessment and performance across 
multiple platforms. In one embodiment, aggregate alignment assessments 
based on all the lexical benchmarks selected by the user <b>601</b>, content volume published <b>603</b>, values assessment <b>604</b>, tone assessment <b>605</b>, style assessments <b>606</b>, and details of the levels of values and/or style and other lexical elements <b>607</b>
 are displayed in graphic form. These values are relevant to specific 
platforms and can be filtered by variables such as time-period and other
 factors. For example, platforms could include Facebook, LinkedIn, web 
hooks, client e-mails, blogs, or the similar. A listing is displayed of 
content that is provided on each of these specific platforms. Content 
feeds are processed with individualized metrics or performance 
indicators <b>602</b>. Exemplary key performance indicators can be click
 through rates, engagement rates, etc. All content is scored for 
alignment across values, tone and style and can be filtered to uncover 
correlations and predictive lexical patterns of higher performing 
content based on the metrics and indicators. Content consistency and 
alignment can be determined across specific platforms. Similarly, 
opportunities to strengthen content response on certain platforms are 
identified as well as diagnosing the reason certain content is or is not
 resonating for target stakeholders. Content alignment assessment and 
performance results are shown in aggregate and at an individual content 
document level.<br>(44) Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, any one or more of the elements illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may be implemented as or within an computer system exemplified by the computer system <b>700</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The illustrated computer system includes one or more general purpose processors or central processing units (CPUs) <b>701</b> communicatively coupled to a memory resource <b>710</b> and to an input/output hub <b>720</b> to which various I/O resources and/or components are communicatively coupled. The I/O resources explicitly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> include a network interface <b>740</b>, commonly referred to as a NIC (network interface card), storage resources <b>730</b>, and additional I/O devices, components, or resources <b>750</b>
 including as non-limiting examples, keyboards, mice, displays, 
printers, speakers, microphones, etc. The illustrated computer system <b>700</b> includes a baseboard management controller (BMC) <b>760</b>
 providing, among other features and services, an out-of-band management
 resource which may be coupled to a management server (not depicted). In
 at least some embodiments, BMC <b>760</b> may manage computer system <b>700</b> even when computer system <b>700</b> is powered off or powered to a standby state. BMC <b>760</b>
 may include a processor, memory, an out-of-band network interface 
separate from and physically isolated from an in-band network interface 
of computer system <b>700</b>, and/or other embedded computer resources. In certain embodiments, BMC <b>760</b> may include or may be an integral part of a remote access controller.<br>(45)
